# @seatgeek/plugin-awards-common

Welcome to the common package for awards plugin!

This common package provides shared types and utility functions used by the
frontend and backend awards plugin.

Every time we find the need to change the awards type or to add common utilities
for testing, we added it to this plugin.

This allows us to keep a consistent representation of awards across our frontend
and backend.
